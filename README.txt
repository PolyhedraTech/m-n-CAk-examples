Wildfire_on_R.py: File containing the fire cellular automaton. When executed, it displays a video of its propagation.
vegetation_map.doc: Raster file containing the description of the vegetation layer.
vegetation_map.img: Raster file containing the data of the vegetation layer.
humidity_map.doc: Raster file containing the description of the humidity layer.
humidity_map.img: Raster file containing the data of the humidity layer.

Goal of Wildfire_on_R.py:
The goal of the code in Wildfire_on_R.py is to simulate the spread of a wildfire using a cellular automaton model bsed on m:n-CAk
The simulation takes into account various factors such as vegetation type, humidity levels, and wind direction to model the propagation of the fire over a landscape. The output of the simulation is a video that visually represents the spread of the wildfire over time, providing insights into how different conditions affect the fire's behavior.
